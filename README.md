# image_data_cleansing
Würth Capstone Project
Development of a machine learning model to classify images into "good" (containing clear, recognizable images of Würth products) and "bad" (absence of products or failing to meet the "good" criteria)

image_processing.ipynb was run locally to perform the data exploration and augmentation, and upload the images to Google Drive 
model_building.ipynb was run on Google Colab to train and evaluate the model.
